# HistoricallyFamousLighthouses.com

This is a repository that contains a copy of the code I use for [Historically Famous Lighthouse](https://www.historicallyfamouslighthouses.com/). I say copy because I actually host it elsewhere.

The website is basically just [the templates](https://designsystem.digital.gov/page-templates/) provided by the [U.S. Web Design System team](https://designsystem.digital.gov/). I like to think of the USWDS as Bootstrap for the public sector (I am almost definitely not the first person to say that). It really is just so easy to use.

Other than using USWDS, the only other thing I can think of that would help you, as a contributor, is that I like using includes, so I made this website using pHp.

If you have any thoughts or suggestions, please have at it!
